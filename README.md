Introduction To Game Programming Prototype

This assessment was based on functionality and useablility, the objective was to create a functional prototype for the proposed game from my previous assessment. Therefore my focus throught development was based almost entirely on functionality and a very light amount of artistics were provided for this project stage. In the future my next stage in development will be creating the art and style of the game. The features propesed in the first assessment that meet the specifications for a prototype not concerning graphical design have been implemented.

I have layed out a production plan that I used to help structure my development process. Using trello I was able to create new cards with specific information in the layout I provided so I understood where I was in development and what I needed to do. This also broke tasks down into simple steps I could easily follow and complete.
